# ============ Team Configuration ============
# Uncomment and customize for multi-agent team setup

# team:
#   name: "my-team"           # Team identifier
#   runId: "project-alpha"    # Project/run ID for memory partitioning
#   
#   # Agent definitions
#   agents:
#     - id: "main"
#       role: "coordinator"
#       name: "Main Agent"
#       channels: ["feishu"]
#       description: "Main orchestrator and user interface"
#
#     - id: "tech-lead"
#       role: "architect"
#       name: "Tech Lead"
#       channels: ["feishu", "discord"]
#       description: "Technical decisions and architecture"
#
#     - id: "dev-bot"
#       role: "developer"
#       name: "Dev Bot"
#       channels: ["discord"]
#       description: "Code implementation"
#
#     - id: "algo-bot"
#       role: "algorithm"
#       name: "Algorithm Bot"
#       channels: ["discord"]
#       description: "Algorithm design and optimization"
#
#     - id: "devops-bot"
#       role: "operations"
#       name: "DevOps Bot"
#       channels: ["discord"]
#       description: "Infrastructure and deployment"

# ============ Memory Configuration ============

memory:
  # Team shared memory path (relative to _omp/)
  teamSharedPath: "memory/"
  
  # Agent-specific memory path template
  # {agent_id} will be replaced with the actual agent ID
  agentScopesPath: "agents/{agent_id}/memory/"
  
  # Handoff records path
  handoffsPath: "memory/handoffs/"

# ============ Agent Roles ============
# Available roles:
#   - coordinator: Main orchestrator (e.g., 'main')
#   - architect: Technical lead, architecture decisions
#   - developer: Code implementation
#   - algorithm: Algorithm specialist
#   - operations: DevOps, infrastructure
#   - researcher: Research and analysis
#   - writer: Documentation
#   - reviewer: Code review
#   - custom: User-defined role

# ============ Memory Scopes ============
# Scope determines memory visibility:
#   - team: Visible to all agents (e.g., architecture decisions)
#   - agent: Private to specific agent (e.g., work progress)
#
# When searching, agents see:
#   1. Their own agent-scoped memories
#   2. Team-scoped memories (if includeTeamMemory=true)

# ============ Handoff Protocol ============
# When an agent needs to pass work to another:
#
# 1. Source agent creates handoff:
#    - Context: What was accomplished
#    - Progress: Completion percentage
#    - Artifacts: Related files
#
# 2. Target agent accepts/rejects:
#    - On accept: Takes over the work
#    - On reject: Returns to source
#
# 3. Completion:
#    - Target agent marks complete
#    - Notes any follow-ups

# ============ Example: OpenClaw Team ============
# team:
#   name: "openclaw"
#   runId: "openclaw-v1"
#   agents:
#     - id: "main"
#       role: "coordinator"
#       channels: ["feishu"]
#     - id: "tech-lead"
#       role: "architect"
#       channels: ["feishu", "discord"]
#     - id: "dev-bot"
#       role: "developer"
#       channels: ["discord"]
#     - id: "algo-bot"
#       role: "algorithm"
#       channels: ["discord"]
#     - id: "devops-bot"
#       role: "operations"
#       channels: ["discord"]
